Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.


Custom Bootstrap Compilation
^^^^^^

The generated CSS is set up with automatic Bootstrap recompilation with variables of your choice.
Bootstrap v4.1.1 is installed using npm and customised by tweaking your variables in ``static/sass/custom_bootstrap_vars``.

You can find a list of available variables `in the bootstrap source`_, or get explanations on them in the `Bootstrap docs`_.
